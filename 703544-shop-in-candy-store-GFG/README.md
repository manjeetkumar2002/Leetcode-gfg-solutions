Find the minimum and maximum amount of money&nbsp;needed to buy all the candies.Note:&nbsp;In both cases, you must take the maximum number of free candies possible during each purchase.
Examples : 
Input: prices[] = [3, 2, 1, 4], k = 2Output: [3, 7]Explanation: As according to the offer if you buy one candy you can take at most k more for free.

In the second case, you can buy the candy worth 4 and takes candies worth 1 and 2 for free, also you need to buy candy worth 3. So max cost: 3+4 = 7.
Input: prices[] = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5], k = 4
