# [Separate Chaining in Hashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/separate-chaining-in-hashing-1587115621/1)
## Easy
Given an integer m representing the size of a hash table and an array arr[] of distinct integers, insert all the elements of the array into the hash table using the Separate Chaining technique.
Return a 2D array, where each index of the outer array represents a slot in the hash table, and the corresponding inner array contains all the elements stored in that slot, in the order they were inserted.
Note: In the Separate Chaining technique, each slot of the hash table is implemented as a linked list. If multiple elements map to the same slot (i.e., a collision occurs), they are stored in the linked list for that slot in the order they are inserted.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [6, 4, 10, 13, 5],  m = 4
Output: [[4], [13, 5], [6, 10], []]
Explanation:6 % 4 = 2, so 6 is inserted into slot 2.
4 % 4 = 0, so 4 is inserted into slot 0.
10 % 4 = 2, so it is appended to the linked list at slot 2 after 6.
13 % 4 = 1, so it is inserted into slot 1.
5 % 4 = 1, so it is appended to the linked list at slot 1 after 13.
Input: arr[] = [12, 45, 36, 86, 10], m = 3
Output: [[12, 45, 36], [10], [86]]
Explanation:12 % 3 = 0, so 12 is inserted into slot 0.
45 % 3 = 0, so it is appended to the linked list at slot 0.
36 % 3 = 0, so it is appended after 45 in slot 0.
86 % 3 = 2, so it is inserted into slot 2.
10 % 3 = 1, so it is inserted into slot 1.
