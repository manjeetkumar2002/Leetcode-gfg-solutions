# [Juggler Sequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/juggler-sequence3930/1)
## Easy
Juggler Sequence is a series of integers&nbsp;in which the first term starts with a positive integer number&nbsp;a&nbsp;and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation:Given a number n, find the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence until it becomes 1.
Examples:
Input: n = 9
Output: 9 27 140 11 36 6 2 1
Explaination: We start with 9 and use 
above formula to get next terms.
Input: n = 6
Output: 6 2 1
Explaination: 
[61/2] = 2. 
[21/2] = 1.
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 100
